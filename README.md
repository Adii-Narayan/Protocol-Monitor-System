# 🔍 Protocol Upgrade Monitoring System

A comprehensive dashboard for monitoring blockchain protocol upgrade proposals, forecasting risks, and extracting real-time metrics across governance, sentiment, and market data.

## 📌 Introduction

The **Protocol Upgrade Monitoring System** is designed to help stakeholders—developers, DAO members, researchers, and token holders—analyze and interpret governance proposals and evaluate potential risks associated with protocol upgrades.

The system pulls live data from smart contracts, governance portals, DeFi platforms, and social media to provide a unified view of token metrics, sentiment, and upgrade risk scores.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 **Network Monitor**  
  View contract metadata including name, compiler version, and verification status.

- 🗳️ **Governance Proposals**  
  Fetch and display proposals from Snapshot.org for selected networks.

- 💰 **Token Price Tracker**  
  Live price data with 24h change and interactive 30-day trend graphs.

- 💧 **TVL Monitor & Forecast**  
  Track and forecast Total Value Locked (TVL) using Facebook Prophet.

- 📉 **Volatility Forecasting**  
  Predict token price volatility using GARCH models.

- 💬 **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**  
  Analyze sentiment trends for protocol discussions using TextBlob.

- 🚨 **Upgrade Risk Score**  
  Classify upgrade proposals into High/Medium/Low risk based on:
  - Code complexity  
  - Governance participation rate  
  - Voting duration  
  - Sentiment score  
  - Proposal description keywords

## 🧠 System Design Overview

- Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based dashboard.
- Uses APIs from:
  - **Snapshot** (governance data)
  - **CoinGecko** and **DefiLlama** (token market and TVL)
  - **Twitter** API (tweet collection)
  - **Etherscan** (contract metadata)
- Forecasting powered by:
  - **Facebook Prophet** for TVL trends  
  - **GARCH models** (via `arch`) for volatility
